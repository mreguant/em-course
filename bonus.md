# Bonus notebooks (TBA)

I will post here additional material replicating other papers.

## A model of the Western Interconnection

The exercise will be based on the paper by [Fowlie, Petersen, and Reguant (2021)](/materials/day3/pandp.20211073.pdf). Reading the paper in advance is encouraged.

A repository of the conference paper can be found [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/131024/version/V1/view). The [online appendix](https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=14554) is particularly helpful, given how short the paper is.
