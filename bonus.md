# Bonus notebooks

I will post here additional material replicating other papers.

## A model of the Western Interconnection

The exercise will be based on the paper by [Fowlie, Petersen, and Reguant (2021)](/materials/day3/pandp.20211073.pdf). Reading the paper in advance is encouraged. The exercise is model-based.

A repository of the conference paper can be found [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/131024/version/V1/view). The [online appendix](https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=14554) is particularly helpful, given how short the paper is.

## Estimating consumer responses to real-time and time-of-use prices
The exercises will be based on the papers by Fabra, Rapson, Reguant, and Wang (2021) and Enrich, Mizrahi, Li, and Reguant (2023). Reading the papers in advance is encouraged to follow the materials. The main analysis is regressions, IV, and diff-in-diffs.

## Examining energy poverty in Spain

TBA

## Problem set on market power (uses mixed integer)

The exercise is based on the baseline model covered in the course, but with a mixed integer formulation which allows to consider a non-competitive equilibrium.

## Problem set on rooftop solar and net metering (uses complementarity conditions / mixed integer)
The exercise is based on the baseline model covered in the course, but with a mixed integer formulation. It considers investment decisions by households by reformulating what determines the profitability of solar (zero profit condition). The zero profit condition changes depending on the retribution rules for rooftop solar.
