### Preliminaries

We will be using Julia and Pluto.jl to run the exercises. For this, **you will need to install Julia in your computer, and add the Pluto package to Julia.** 

You can follow this amazing guide form MIT to get started into installing this in your computer: [How to install Julia and Pluto.jl](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/)
