In this **5-day course**, we will learn about the **economics of electricity markets** and how to use code to model them. The class is taught by [Mar Reguant](https://mreguant.github.io).

The goal of the course is threefold:
* Get familiar with trends and changes in the electricity market.
* Get familiar with how to use data and models of electricity markets. 
* Get familiar with how machine learning tools can help with the above.

## Preliminaries

We will be using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and Python to run the exercises. For this, **you will need to install Python and Jupyter Notebooks in your computer.**  

:exclamation: It is **highly recommended** to make sure you can use Python and Jupyter Notebooks before class starts. We will also spend time the first day to get this going.


## Flow
Each day, we will cover topics in the first half of the class, and then we will do examples in the second half. You will be able to modify the exercises at home for additional practice.

In each **day page** you will find the necessary material:
* [Day 1](menu1): Introduction
* [Day 2](menu2): Supply side I
* [Day 3](menu3): Supply side II
* [Day 4](menu4): Demand side I
* [Day 5](menu5): Demand side II
