# Day 2: Supply side I

In the second lecture, we will talk about how to model electricity markets using mathematical programming tools. 

In the practical session, we will get familiar with a dataset of electricity market hourly data from California, learn about how to simplify the data using clustering techniques, and set up an economic model of a simple electricity market.

## Lecture

* **Slides**: [day2.pdf](/materials/day2/day2.pdf)

## Practical exercise: A model of the electricity sector

The exercise will be based on the paper by Reguant (2019), "The Efficiency and Sectoral Distributional Impacts of Large-Scale Renewable Energy Policies". Reading the paper in advance is encouraged.

* **Exercise file**: [day2.jl](/materials/day2/day2.jl)

* **Data file**: [data_jaere.csv](/materials/day2/data_jaere.csv), [data\_technology\_simple.csv](/materials/day2/data_technology_simple.csv)

<!-- ## Homework -->
> :exclamation: Save the exercise Julia file and the data CSV file in the same folder. Then, open the exercise Julia file from Pluto to start exploring.
