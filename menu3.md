# Day 3: Supply side II

In the third lecture, we will talk about environmental regulation and how it affects participants in the electricity market. 

In the practical session, we will continue to learn how to use JuMP to build electricity models. We will incorporate investment and environmental regulation into a model with a richer set of plants. We will also practice ways in which to save and loop over several simulations.

## Lecture

* **Slides**: [day3.pdf](/materials/day3/day3.pdf)
* **Supplementary Slides**: [slides_chile.pdf](/materials/day3/slides_chile.pdf)

## Practical exercise: Supply climate policies and leakage

The exercise will be based on the paper by Reguant (2019), "The Efficiency and Sectoral Distributional Impacts of Large-Scale Renewable Energy Policies". Reading the paper in advance is encouraged.

* **Exercise file**: [day3.ipynb](/materials/day3/day3.ipynb)
  
* **Data file**: [data\_jaere\_clustered.csv](/materials/day2/data_jaere_clustered.csv), [data\_technology.csv](/materials/day2/data_technology.csv)

<!-- ## Homework -->
> :exclamation: Save the exercise Julia file (.ipynb) and the data zip file in the same folder. You need to unzip de data\_leakage folder. It should appear as a subfolder with the same name, "data\_leakage". It contains several .csv files. Then, open the exercise Julia file from Jupyter Notebooks to start exploring. 
Note that the .pdf file provides a snapshot of the exercise. It does not require any installation but it will not allow interactions.
