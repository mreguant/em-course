# Day 4: Demand side I

In the fourth lecture, we will talk about how demand actions can contribute to the energy transition, via energy efficiency and demand response.

In the practical session, we will learn how to use machine learning tools to estimate the response to real-time pricing.

## Lecture

* **Slides**: [day4.pdf](/materials/day4/day4.pdf), [schools_bgse.pdf](/materials/day4/schools_bgse.pdf), [slides_rtp.pdf](/materials/day4/slides_rtp.pdf)

## Practical exercise: Dynamic pricing in retail

The exercise will be based on the paper by Fabra, Rapson, Reguant, and Wang (2021). Reading the paper in advance is encouraged.

* **Exercise file**: [day4.jl](/materials/day4/day4.jl) / [day4_julia.pdf](/materials/day4/day4_julia.pdf)

* **Data file**: [data_rtp.csv](/materials/day4/data_rtp.csv)

<!-- ## Homework -->
> :exclamation: Save the exercise Julia file (.jl) and the data zip file in the same folder. Then, open the exercise Julia file from Pluto to start exploring. Note that the .pdf file provides a snapshot of the exercise. It does not require any installation but it will not allow interactions.
