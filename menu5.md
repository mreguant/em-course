# Day 5: Demand side II

In the fifth lecture, we will talk about the potential uneven impacts of the energy transition, with a focus on the electricity sector.

In the practical session, we will learn how to combine machine learning tools applied to smart meter data with Census data to estimate the heterogeneity impacts of energy policies. 

## Lecture

## Practical exercise: Heterogeneous consumers

The exercise will be based on the paper by Wang, Reguant, Fabra, and Cahana (work in progress). Paper not yet available for distribution.
